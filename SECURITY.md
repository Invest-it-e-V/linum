## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please contact support@investit-academy.de if you have identified security vulnerabilities within the latest app package. We will do our best to fix such errors ASAP. You can also create an advisory on this repository to let us know. **Do not report security vulnerabilities via regular issues.**

## Deleting your account
