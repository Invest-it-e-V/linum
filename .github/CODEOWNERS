### LINUM - CODE OWNERS MASTER FILE ###

# TL;DR: If you want to add ownership to a new file, scroll ALL THE WAY DOWN

## How to use ##

# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# When creating new files for the app, please consider adding
# yourself or at least one of your teammates as a code owner.

# A code owner is someone who takes responsibility and is
# accountable for the classes and files they are assigned to.
# They also act as a point of contact in case of questions.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. For example, when someone opens a pull request that 
# only modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
# *.js    @js-owner

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
# *.go docs@example.com

## Usage Examples ##

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
# /build/logs/ @doctocat

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
# docs/*  docs@example.com

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# ANYWHERE in your repository.
# apps/ @octocat

# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
# /docs/ @doctocat

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in a `/logs` directory such as
# `/build/logs`, `/scripts/logs`, and `/deeply/nested/logs`. Any changes
# in a `/logs` directory will require approval from @octocat.
# **/logs @octocat

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in the `/apps`
# directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github`
# subdirectory, as its owners are left empty.
# /apps/ @octocat
# /apps/github

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in the `/apps`
# directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github`
# subdirectory, as this subdirectory has its own owner @doctocat
# /apps/ @octocat
# /apps/github @doctocat


### PART A: GENERAL CODE OWNERS ###

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @NightmindOfficial and @damattl will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @NightmindOfficial @damattl

### PART B: FLUTTER BASE FILES ###

# These files shouldn't really be edited by anyone.
# Edits require maintainer approval.



### PART B: DANGER ZONE - MANUAL SPECIFIC APPROVAL ###

# Editing this CODEOWNER File can be done by anybody, but the
# final change for our default branch has to be approved by:
/.github/CODEOWNERS @NightmindOfficial



### PART C: The SHIT Files (SHIT - Submit Hastily, Ignore Traditions) ###

# These files are mostly non-code or at least cannot break the code, so no 
# specific approval is needed beside the mandatory one from PR restrictions.

### PART D: CONCEPTS & FEATURES ### <---------------------- add your ownership here if you are designing an entire feature

### PART E: EVERYTHING ELSE ### <-------------------------- add your ownership here if you are the owner of a file not related to a specific feature
