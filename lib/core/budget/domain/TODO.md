## Logic
- Implement the firebase adapter = datasource
  - Repository accesses db via adapter
  - Use the same adapter and repository for MainBudget and Budget
- Decide on the remaining structuring (What is necessary)
- Implement use cases: Update Budget (all, only one, all before, all after), Delete (''')
- Automatic MainBudget calculation
  - Gather recurring income entries and calculate the budget
- BudgetPresets
  - How to implement?
  - How to Store?
- Many more...

## UI
- Remaining Budget Cards
- Adjustment Sliders and Input fields
- Many more.... (Feel free to add)
- Warn the user if his budget is larger than his balance
